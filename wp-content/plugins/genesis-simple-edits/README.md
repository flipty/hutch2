# Genesis Simple Edits

This plugin lets you edit the three most commonly modified areas in any Genesis theme: the post-info (byline), the post-meta, and the footer area.

## DEPRECATION NOTICE
This plugin is now deprecated and will no longer receive feature updates. The reason for deprecation is due to the Genesis Framework parent theme allowing similar functionality, which can be found in the WordPress dashboard under
- Genesis → Theme Settings → Singular Content
- Genesis → Theme Settings → Footer

For more information about how to use these features in Genesis Framework, see this article:
